// --- task 1 ----

/ *Can you find the needle in the haystack?

Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle"

After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:

"found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle, so:

findNeedle(['hay', 'junk', 'hay', 'hay', 'moreJunk', 'needle', 'randomJunk'])
should return "found the needle at position 5" (in COBOL "found the needle at position 6") */
function findNeedle(haystack) {
  return "found the needle at position " + haystack.indexOf('needle');
}

// --- task 2 ---
/* Let's play! You have to return which player won! In case of a draw return Draw!.

Examples:

rps('scissors','paper') // Player 1 won!
rps('scissors','rock') // Player 2 won!
rps('paper','paper') // Draw! */
const rps = (p1, p2) => {
  
};
